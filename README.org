#+STARTUP: overview

* Simple RAG - Retrieval Augmentet Generation.

** Core idea:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Large language models (LLMs) are great at composition and reasoning, but
their factual recall is limited to what was baked into their weights at
pre-training time. 
#+END_QUOTE

RAG remedies this by:
1. Retrieving relevant pieces of external knowledge on-the-fly with a fast
   vector search;
2. Supplying those snippets to a generator model, which uses
   them to craft the final answer.
